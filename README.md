## The Short Version:
Furrimals aims to improve business and brand loyalty for local shops and provide customers with a rewards scheme through the collection of loveable, virtual ‘furrimals’. Going off the success of Woolworths Ooshies and online gamification trends, Furrimals can be collected by entering the code that would be found on one’s shopping receipt. The collection of these animals can be seen by your friends for competitive fun, and future updates would see features such as discount codes being provided for collecting a certain amount! See if you can catch ‘em all!
